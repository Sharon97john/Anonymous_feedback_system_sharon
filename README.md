# Anonymous Feedback System

In today's increasingly competitive world, it is essential to have quality education. The quality of a higher education University can be improved through continuous feedback collection and accomodating appropriate changes. Considering the University as a whole, student and staff feedback are critical. An internal feedback system is vital for maintaining the standards and overall growth of the institution. Students and staff's perspectives must be integrated into a regular and ongoing cycle of reporting, analysis, implementation, and feedback to contribute effectively to internal improvement initiatives. Based on a survey, around 82.5\% students did not have a clear idea of whom to approach with suggestions. The survey results gave a primary foundation for the motivation behind this project. 

By the end of the study, a feedback collection system is effectively created, with the potential for more features in future. The system's present features were created after discussions with participants and with the time limit in mind. The system could useÂ features like the ability to reply to feedback, better filtering, sample templates to make it easier for administrators to develop feedback forms, etc. The findings of the user evaluation show how essential this system is in a higher education setting.
