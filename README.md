# Anonymous Feedback System

In today’s increasingly competitive world, it is essential to have a quality education. The quality of a higher education university can be improved through continuous feedback collection and appropriate changes. Considering the university as a whole, student and staff feedback are critical. An internal feedback system is vital for maintaining the standards and overall growth of the institution. Students and staff’s perspectives must be integrated into a regular and ongoing cycle of reporting, analysis, implementation, and feedback to contribute effectively to internal improvement initiatives. Based on a survey, it was pretty clear that 82.5% students did not have a clear idea of whom to approach with suggestions. The survey results give a primary foundation for the motivation behind this project. This project aims to develop a fully-fledged website for anonymous feedback collection across all departments in the university.
